This is repository to demonstrate Azure Kubernetes Service configuration that I have done.
I have launched Kubernetes cluster on Microsoft Azure. For this cluster I have applied Kubernetes Deployment using YAML file to deploy 3 pods. I have applied Kubernetes Service with the type: LoadBalancer to expose those 2 pods that I have created. 

Unfortunately, out of worry that I might receive unexpected Azure costs (I don't have sufficient knowledge about Azure pricing) I have shut down the cluster.
